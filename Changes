Imager-File-GIF 0.88
====================

 - eliminate various set but otherwise unused variables caught by GCC.

Imager-File-GIF 0.87
====================

 - add the missing 0.86 changes list

 - update README

Imager-File-GIF 0.86
====================

 - avoid re-entrancy to giflib using the mutex API

Imager-File-GIF 0.85
====================

 - add giflib 5.0 support.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=79029
   The giflib API Imager uses doesn't have a mechanism to set the
   header version in 5.0.0.

 - previously a transparency enabled write (the default) would always
   use a GIF89a header even if none of the images were transparent.

 - update the GIF library probe code to check for the new giflib 5.0.1
   EGifSetGifVersion() function, and to check for the giflib 4.2.0
   uninitialized gif89 bug.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=79679
   http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3574283&group_id=102202&atid=631304

 - clean up .dSYM directories generated performing probes on OS X
   Mountain Lion.

 - pass the --verbose command-line option through to Imager::Probe in
   Makefile.PL
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75878

Imager-File-GIF 0.84 - released with Imager 0.92_01
====================

 - giflib 4.2 eliminates the GIF_LIB_VERSION macro, handle that
   correctly for both probing and runtime.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=77672

 - allow building with C89 compilers

Imager-File-GIF 0.83
====================

 - no longer fallback to using DynaLoader to load the XS code
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75560

Imager-File-GIF 0.82
====================

 - modify to use the new buffered I/O functions instead of calling
   I/O layer callbacks directly.

 - handle I/O close errors properly

Imager-File-GIF 0.81
====================

 - update the bundled (and still modified) Devel::CheckLib
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69170

 - use snprintf() when imconfig.h indicates it's available
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69147

Imager-File-GIF 0.80
====================

 - the big types cleanup

 - refuse to write images (or screens) that are too large to represent.

Imager-File-GIF 0.79
====================

 - writing a paletted image to GIF wouldn't always use the colors
   supplied (or generated, eg. via make_colors => "mono"), which was
   confusing at best.  Requires changes from Imager 0.84.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=67912

 - replace (imager|tony)@imager.perl.org in the doc, since I don't
   plan to continue receiving mail at that address.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=68591

Imager-File-GIF 0.78
====================

Split out from Imager.

Imager-File-GIF 0.81
====================

   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69170

 - use snprintf() when imconfig.h indicates it's available
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69147

Imager-File-GIF 0.80
====================

 - the big types cleanup

 - refuse to write images (or screens) that are too large to represent.

Imager-File-GIF 0.79
====================

 - writing a paletted image to GIF wouldn't always use the colors
   supplied (or generated, eg. via make_colors => "mono"), which was
   confusing at best.  Requires changes from Imager 0.84.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=67912

 - replace (imager|tony)@imager.perl.org in the doc, since I don't
   plan to continue receiving mail at that address.

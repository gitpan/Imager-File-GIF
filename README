Imager::File::GIF provides GIF file format support for Imager.

It requires libgif to be installed, including development headers.

This is currently shipped as part of Imager, but Imager may install
with out installing Imager::File::GIF, so if you need GIF support, add
a dependency on Imager::File::GIF.
